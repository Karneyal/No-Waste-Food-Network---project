# No-Waste-Food-Network---project
No Waste Food Network is a web-based application developed to minimize food wastage by connecting food donors with receivers in need. The platform allows donors, such as restaurants and individuals, to register and post surplus food details, while registered receivers, such as NGOs , can view available donations and request pickups.
